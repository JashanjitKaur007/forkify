      <div class="Makki"><p>Sesame Balls, also known as Jian Dui or Jin Deui, are popular<br>Chinese pastries made from glutinous rice flour and filled with sweet bean<br> paste or lotus seed paste.

  <div class="sa">
    <p class="p">To prepare Sesame Balls:</p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li><p>In a mixing bowl, combine glutinous rice flour, sugar, and water to form<br> a smooth dough.</p></li>
      <li><p>Divide the dough into small portions and flatten each portion into a circle.</p></li>
      <li><p>Place a small amount of sweet bean paste or lotus seed paste in the <br>center of each dough circle.</p></li>
      <li><p>Wrap the dough around the filling to form a ball, ensuring that the<br> filling is completely enclosed.</p></li>
      <li><p>Roll each ball in sesame seeds until evenly coated.</p></li>
      <li><p>Heat oil in a deep frying pan over medium heat. Carefully add the sesame<br> balls to the hot oil and fry until they are golden brown and crispy.</p></li>
      <li><p>Remove the sesame balls from the oil and drain on paper towels to remove <br>excess oil.</p></li>
      <li><p>Let the sesame balls cool slightly before serving. Enjoy them warm or at <br>room temperature.</p></li><br>
