      <div class="Makki"><p>Fried rice is a popular and versatile dish in many Asian cuisines,<br> known for its simplicity, flavor, and ability to incorporate various ingredients.<br> It originated in China but has since spread to other parts of Asia and<br> the world, with each region adding its own twist to the recipe.</p><br>
      <p>The basic components of fried rice include cooked rice, typically leftover <br>rice that has been cooled to prevent it from sticking together. This rice<br> is then stir-fried with a mixture of ingredients such as <br>vegetables, eggs, meat, seafood, and seasonings.</p>
