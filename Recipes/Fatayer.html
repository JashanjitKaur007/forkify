      <p class="p">To prepare Fatayer:</p>
      <ol type="1">
        <li><p>In a small bowl, dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water. Let it<br> sit for about 5 minutes until foamy.</p></li>
        <li><p>In the meantime, prepare the filling by mixing together chopped<br> spinach, crumbled feta cheese, chopped parsley, chopped<br> onion, minced garlic, lemon juice, ground sumac (if using), salt, <br>and pepper in a bowl.</p></li>
        <li><p>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment<br> paper.</p></li>
        <li><p>Punch down the risen dough and divide it into equal-sized balls.<br> Roll out each ball into a circle on a floured <br>surface.</p></li>
        <li><p>Place a spoonful of the filling in the center of each dough circle. <br>Fold the edges of the dough over the filling to form a triangle or<br> boat shape, pinching the edges together<br> to seal.</p></li>
        <li><p>Arrange the stuffed pastries on the prepared baking sheet. Brush the<br> tops with olive oil.</p></li>
        <li><p>Bake in the preheated oven for 15-20 minutes, or until golden brown.</p></li>
        <li><p>Remove from the oven and let cool slightly before serving. Enjoy<br> Fatayer warm or at room temperature.</p></li>
