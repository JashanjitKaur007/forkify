        <p>Shawarma is a popular Middle Eastern street food made with thinly<br> sliced meat, typically lamb, chicken, or beef, that has <br>been marinated and roasted on a vertical spit. The meat is shaved<br> off in thin slices and usually served wrapped in a flatbread such as pita,<br> along with various toppings and sauces.</p><br>
        <p>To make Shawarma at home, marinate thinly sliced meat in a <br>flavorful mixture of spices, garlic, lemon juice, and yogurt, <br>then roast it on a vertical rotisserie or in the oven until<br> tender and golden brown. Serve the sliced meat in a flatbread with <br>your choice of toppings and sauces for a delicious<br> and satisfying meal.</p>

      <p class="p">To prepare Shawarma:</p>
      <ol type="1">
        <li><p>In a large bowl, combine minced garlic, lemon juice, plain yogurt,<br> olive oil, ground cumin, paprika, ground turmeric, ground<br> cinnamon, cayenne pepper, salt, and pepper. Mix well to make<br> the marinade.</p></li>
        <li><p>Add the thinly sliced meat to the marinade and toss until evenly<br> coated. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, <br>or overnight for best results.</p></li>
        <li><p>If using a vertical rotisserie, thread the marinated meat<br> onto the spit and cook according to the manufacturer's instructions <br>until golden brown and cooked through. If using an oven, preheat the<br> oven to 180°C (350°F) and roast the meat on a baking sheet for 25-30 minutes,<br> or until cooked through.</p></li>
        <li><p>Once cooked, remove the meat from the rotisserie or oven and<br> let it rest for a few minutes before slicing<br> thinly.</p></li>
        <li><p>Warm the flatbreads in a skillet or oven. Place a generous<br> amount of sliced meat on each flatbread, along with sliced<br> tomatoes, onions, and cucumbers.</p></li>
        <li><p>Drizzle with tahini sauce, garlic sauce, or hot sauce, if desired.<br> Roll up the flatbreads tightly and serve immediately.</p></li>
        <li><p>Enjoy Shawarma hot as a delicious street food-style meal!</p></li>
